# OpenVerse✨

## Greetings🙋‍♂️
Hey everyone! I know how awesome [Paraverse](https://paraverse.feutech.edu.ph/portal/) is. It brings us iTamaraws closer to one another. My favorite feature of Paraverse is definitely briefcase🤗💼. Anyway, the problem I find with Paraverse is we can't see under the hood. We don't know how it works or what makes it tick. That is absolutelty fine though! It is FEU Tech's property. 

But that does not stop a madlad like me to create my own version of Paraverse. I call it **OpenVerse**. I want to cultivate a sense of transparency and collaboration between experienced and new developers in FEU Tech. So here it is, currently in development and open-source.

## Why OpenVerse❓
The best advantage of OpenVerse is that it is built on the modern, industry-based technology like Next.js. I think it is the best framework for begginers to start on. It is convienient because you can easily deploy your own version of this app using Vercel. And since the latter is serverless, you can expect to run it without cost. I also use Supabase for the database of Aral and used Prisma as the ORM. Lastly, I used Tailwind to make components faster and easier. I don't want to mimic the services made by Paraverse since it is far too complex for one man to handle. But since it is open-source, in the future I want to see students build features on their own.

## Aral
Aral is a centralized platform where you can get the best resources to advance your college career. Personally, I used a lot of these and helped me to become an AI Engineer. I want you to do the same (but 100x better than me😉). 

### Imporant Disclaimer
First, I will be publishing guides soon so that you can get started and work your way around OpenVerse. Second, this is by no means a replacement to Paraverse. You should still use it! I made OpenVerse so that students will know how tech works. It this way, they can experience what it's like coding in the industry.
